# Manual Intervention Tracking in Automated Production

## Patent DE102021105260B3

### Summary

As part of the Packaging Valley Makeathon 2020, a fellow student and I worked on the task set by Syntegon, formerly Bosch Packaging.
In automated production environments, malfunctions often occur that require manual intervention. Recording these interventions is important for quality assurance and process optimization. Conventional methods such as logbooks or personal experience are often unreliable and time-consuming.
Our approach to this was the automatic creation of a logbook. To do this, we developed a prototype that uses a camera to record the entire work area.
Object recognition is then used to evaluate which tools are being used in which area.
As an outlook, we have said that it is possible to use this data to classify which work is being carried out on the machine.
Syntegon pursued this idea further and developed a patent from this idea, for which my fellow student and I are each registered as co-inventors with 25%.
