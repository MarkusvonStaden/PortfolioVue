# Technology Consultant

## Aalen University - Digital Learning Team

### Job Description

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Aalen University has set up a test center to ensure the safety and health of students and staff. In this context, the university hired me as a tester. I was responsible for carrying out COVID-19 tests and documenting the test results. As the work was quite monotonous, I developed a software solution that largely automated the work. I presented this software to my superior. He likes the idea and offered me a job as a Technology Consultant. Together we added more features to this software. Since then, my tasks have been to develop and implement various software solutions for the university.

### Projects

- Software for test center

  Users could register on a website. Based on the test used, the tester was shown the corresponding instructions. Testers then only had to enter the result. The certificate was then issued automatically and sent by email.

- LMS Admin Panel

  The LMS lacked some important administrative features for us, such as the creation of temporary users. An admin panel was developed to enable these features.
