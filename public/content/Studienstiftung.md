# German Academic Scholarship Foundation

## Overview

### General information

In 2022, my professor and supervisor of my Bachelor's thesis recommended me to the foundation for a scholarship.
He said I was suitable for this scholarship because of my good grades and my social commitment.

### Social commitment

- Fire department

  Before I moved to Aalen to study, I was an active member of the volunteer fire department in Wiesbaden.
  As part of this, I not only took part in operations, but also helped to train the youth fire department.

- Youth forum

  I joined the youth forum in Aalen in 2021. The Youth Forum has set itself the mission of representing the interests of young people and young adults in local politics. Together with a friend, I worked on the expansion of local public transport and cycle paths. In this context, we have exchanged ideas with local political players and representatives of mobility providers in order to find the problem areas and improve the overall situation.

- UStA

  In 2021, I also joined the Independent Student Committee (UStA).
  The UStA is responsible for all aspects of student life, from parties to blood donation campaigns.
  I'm actively involved in organizing the university cinema.
  We offer students at the university a movie once a week in a lecture hall. I was also responsible for catering at the AIM, the local careers fair, in 2022 and 2023.
  Furthermore, I led a group of freshmen on the pub crawl together with my flatmates.

- Micromouse

  My former flatmate and I are currently in the process of organizing a Micromouse competition at the university. At the moment, the individual degree courses have little to do with each other. We want to change that with this competition.
  Mechatronics engineers, electrical engineers and computer scientists have to work together to develop an maze solving model car.
