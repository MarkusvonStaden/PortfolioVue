### Abstract

The goal of this work was the development of a prototype of a robot arm. This includes the design and construction, as well as the development of the firmware. This work was written in the engineering office "Projektraum Reger GmbH" and was commissioned by a customer. The robot arm was made from commercially available parts, mostly from the hobby sector, as well as 3D printed parts. Both FDM and MSLA 3D printing were used. A Nema 17 motor with a 1:100 planetary gearbox is used as the drive in each axis. TMC5160 are used as motor drivers, which are controlled by an ESP32 via SPI. The developed firmware for the ESP is able to calculate the joint positions for all joints using inverse kinematics from a target position given by the user. It was developed in C++ and uses the ESP-IDF framework provided by the manufacturer of the ESP. Two different joints were developed to achieve the 5 degrees of freedom required for the intended application.
