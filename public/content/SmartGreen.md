# Smart Green Island

## 2023

### Overview

As the name suggests, the Smart Green Island Makeathon is all about finding solutions to increasing environmental pollution.
Here, too, there were various challenges from companies.
I won my participation, including travel and accommodation, at the Packaging Valley Makeathon.
My friend and former roommate accompanied me here.

### Challenge

We opted for the challenge from Vishay.
The aim was to combat plastic pollution in open waters.
Our approach was to develop a buoy equipped with sensors.
The idea was that this data could be used to determine where the plastic was floating and where it was accumulating.
The buoy was powered by a small solar cell.
Instead of a lithium battery, a supercapacitor was charged, as these are more environmentally friendly should the buoy sink or get lost.
We used optical sensors to detect plastic in the water.
To get the data away from the buoy, we worked together with the **Aachen Drone Development Initiative**.
A drone flies autonomously to the last known location of the buoy.
It attempts to establish a connection to the buoy via LORA.
If this is not successful, the drone flies a search pattern to find the buoy and transmit the data.
