# Teamlead Technology

## Aalen University - Digital Learning Team

### Job Description

In 2023, my colleague and I took over the leadership of the Technology Department of the Digital Learning Team at Aalen University.
In this role, we are responsible for the digitization of teaching.
We evaluate new tools and implement them as needed.
To advance the digitization of teaching, we also develop our own solutions.

In addition to these tasks, we also offer support to students and lecturers in using the Canvas learning platform and other tools.
Furthermore, we assist startups and companies in developing prototypes and implementing projects.

### Projects

- Chatbot

  To provide students with ChatGPT, we have developed an application that integrates a ChatGPT-based chatbot into the Canvas learning platform.
  Through this integration, students can interact directly with the chatbot within Canvas.
  To ensure data privacy and security, we have developed the application in such a way that student data is not shared with third parties.
  The backend of this application is written in Python using FastAPI and runs on a server at Aalen University.
  The frontend was developed using Vue and is integrated into Canvas via LTI 1.3.
  This project serves as the foundation for a chatbot that will be made available to all universities in the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.

- Semester Transition

  To facilitate the semester transition for lecturers, we have developed an application that copies courses from the last semester into the new semester.
  The application allows courses in Canvas to be linked with the lecture schedule.
  To make this possible, we developed an interface in cooperation with the IT department of Aalen University that imports the lecture schedule from the timetable tool into Canvas. This application has to be maintained and adapted to changes of the LMS API.
