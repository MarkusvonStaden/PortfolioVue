        I am Markus von Staden, currently enriching my academic journey with a
        Master's degree in Machine Learning and Data Analytics. My background in
        Mechatronics has provided a solid foundation in Informatics,
        Microcontrollers, and 3D Printing/CAD. My technical skills are diverse,
        encompassing programming languages like C/C++, Python, and JavaScript,
        and I am well-versed in Docker and Autodesk Fusion360. I have a history
        of participating in and contributing to innovative projects and
        competitions, where I have focused on developing advanced solutions in
        Computer Vision, system automation, and digital security. My role in the
        Volunteer Fire Brigade has not only honed my teamwork abilities but also
        instilled in me a sense of responsibility and leadership, qualities that
        I bring to my academic and professional endeavors. As I continue my
        studies in Machine Learning and Data Analytics, I am eager to explore
        the convergence of these fields with my solid mechatronics background,
        aiming to contribute significantly to the evolving landscape of
        technology and innovation.
